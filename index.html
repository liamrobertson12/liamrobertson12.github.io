          Many economists like Monarch agree that these tariffs have done more harm than good, particularly for U.S. consumers who face higher prices on goods. The costs of maintaining these tariffs are increasingly evident in the form of reduced international trade, disruptions to supply chains, and higher costs for businesses. The consensus among economists is that, on balance, the economic costs of these tariffs outweigh any potential benefits, particularly given the relatively small number of jobs gained in protected industries like steel.

   Professor Monarch states that Since taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden has largely maintained the tariff policies put in place by President Trump. While Biden has expressed publicly skepticism about the effectiveness of tariffs, particularly with regard to their impact on consumer prices, little has changed in terms of the overall tariff structure. As of 2023, a significant portion of U.S. imports from China remains subject to tariffs, with some tariffs according to Monarch reaching as high as 60%.

United States President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to make other countries pay what he and his administration deem “a fair share.” Republicans and Trump have pledged to raise tariffs in order to achieve this goal. Tariffs have long been a subject of intense debate among policymakers, economists, and business leaders alike. According to Ryan Monarch, a professor of economics at Syracuse University, tariffs are used for their potential to raise government revenue. Monarch states that tariffs also play a significant role in shaping international trade. But what exactly is a tariff, why do countries impose them, and what are the broader economic implications?

At its core, a tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods. Professor Monarch describes tariffs as a sort of "sales tax." When goods cross international borders, governments charge importers a fee—usually a percentage of the value of the imported goods—before those goods can enter the domestic market. Tariffs serve several purposes in the economic landscape, but they are often seen as a tool to protect domestic industries. This is part of Trump's plan of protectionism and "America First." By imposing tariffs, governments can make foreign products more expensive relative to domestically produced goods, giving domestic businesses a competitive edge and encouraging consumers to buy locally manufactured products instead of cheaper foreign ones.

During his first term in office, Monarch says that President Donald Trump adopted a more protectionist approach to trade, placing high tariffs on products from China and other countries. In 2018 and 2019, Trump imposed tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports, as well as steel and aluminum from various countries. This move marked a dramatic shift from the free trade policies that had dominated the latter half of the 20th century. While Trump argued that these tariffs would protect American workers and industries, particularly in sectors like steel production, the move also led to a series of retaliatory measures. China, in particular, imposed tariffs on U.S. goods, including agricultural products, which created a tit-for-tat scenario that Monarch referred to as a "trade war." As countries raised tariffs on each other's goods, the result was higher costs for consumers and businesses alike. Supply chains that had previously been optimized for efficiency became disrupted, as companies faced increased costs and uncertainty in trade.

Economists like Monarch have largely criticized the effectiveness of these tariffs. Professor Monarch stated that while certain industries, like U.S. steel, saw job growth due to reduced competition from foreign steel, the broader impact of the tariffs was less positive. Many industries that rely on imports of steel and other raw materials saw their costs rise, and these higher costs were often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. While tariffs may provide short-term relief for specific industries, their broader economic impact is often negative. When tariffs are set too high, as those set against China, they can reduce the volume of imports and exports, potentially leading to inefficiencies in the global supply chain.

Additionally, as tariffs increase, the economic logic behind international trade and a more cooperative global market begins to break down. Ryan Monarch argued that the comparative advantage principle suggests that countries should specialize in the goods and services they can produce most efficiently, and trade with others to access the goods and services that are cheaper to produce elsewhere. However, tariffs disrupt this process, causing countries to produce goods domestically that could be more efficiently sourced from abroad. Not only that, but tariffs can also be a source of political and economic manipulation. Industries that benefit from tariffs—such as steel manufacturers—may lobby for continued protection.

All in all, it seems that tariffs might not be the economic solution that Trump promised they would be.
