Most economists concur that the negative impact of high tariffs, such as increased production costs, outweighs any benefits. Despite some job creation in certain sectors, the overall effect has been harmful, particularly for U.S. consumers who face higher prices. Monarch notes that while tariffs have protected some industries, such as steel, they have also created significant problems in trade relations, leading to disruptions in global supply chains and economic damage across sectors. The costs of these tariffs are being felt more broadly than the benefits they provide.

Professor Monarch states that since his assumption of office in 2021, President Joe Biden has largely preserved the tariff measures implemented by his predecessor, President Donald Trump. Although Biden has raised concerns about the efficacy of the tariffs, especially with regard to consumer prices, not much has been done to alter the existing tariff framework. Monarch points out that importing goods from China to the United States is still highly restricted, with tariffs remaining as high as 60%.        </p>

President-elect Donald Trump has stated that other countries should “contribute their fair share,” a sentiment echoed by some of his administration’s leaders, who have vowed to raise tariffs on imported goods. But what exactly are tariffs, why do countries impose them, and what are the broader economic consequences? According to Ryan Monarch, a professor of economics at Syracuse University, tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. They are used to raise government revenue, protect domestic industries, and influence international trade.

A tariff is essentially a duty or tax levied on goods coming into a country. Monarch describes tariffs as a kind of "sales tax" on imports. When goods cross international borders, governments charge importers a fee, often a percentage of the value of the imported goods, before those goods can enter the domestic market. This can make foreign products more expensive compared to domestically produced goods. In this way, tariffs can protect local businesses by giving them a competitive edge.

During his first term in office, President Trump adopted a protectionist approach to trade, placing high tariffs on products from China and other countries. In 2018 and 2019, Trump imposed tariffs on a wide range of Chinese imports, as well as on steel and aluminum from various countries. This marked a dramatic shift from the free trade policies that had been dominant in the latter half of the 20th century. While Trump argued that these tariffs would protect American workers and industries, especially in sectors like steel production, the move also led to retaliatory measures from other countries. China, for instance, imposed tariffs on U.S. goods, including agricultural products, creating what Monarch described as a “trade war.” As tariffs increased, so did costs for consumers and businesses alike. Supply chains that had previously been optimized for efficiency were disrupted, with companies facing higher costs and trade uncertainty.

Economists like Monarch have largely criticized the effectiveness of these tariffs. While certain industries, like U.S. steel, saw job growth due to reduced competition from foreign steel, the broader impact was less positive. Many industries that rely on imports of steel and other raw materials saw their costs rise, and these higher costs were often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Tariffs may provide short-term relief for specific industries, but their broader economic impact is often negative. When tariffs are set too high, as with the ones imposed on China, they can reduce the volume of imports and exports, potentially leading to inefficiencies in the global supply chain.

Additionally, as tariffs increase, the economic logic behind international trade and a cooperative global market begins to break down. Monarch explained that the principle of comparative advantage suggests that countries should specialize in the goods and services they can produce most efficiently, and trade with others to access products that are cheaper to produce elsewhere. However, tariffs discourage this practice, causing countries to produce goods domestically that could have been more efficiently sourced from abroad. Moreover, tariffs can also be a form of political and economic intervention. Industries that benefit from tariffs, such as steel manufacturers, may lobby for continued protection.

In conclusion, while President Trump argued that tariffs would benefit the U.S. economy, the evidence suggests that tariffs may not be the economic miracle he promised they would be.
